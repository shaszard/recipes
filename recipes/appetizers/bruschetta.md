# Classic Bruschetta

**Prep Time:** 15 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 5 minutes  
**Servings:** 4-6

## Ingredients

- 1 French baguette, sliced diagonally
- 4 ripe tomatoes, diced
- 3 cloves garlic (2 minced, 1 whole for rubbing)
- 1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet and toast for 3-5 minutes until lightly golden.
3. Rub the toasted bread with the whole garlic clove while still warm.
4. In a bowl, combine diced tomatoes, minced garlic, basil, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar.
5. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Let the tomato mixture sit for 10 minutes to allow flavors to meld.
7. Spoon the tomato mixture onto the toasted bread.
8. Top with Parmesan cheese if desired.
9. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- For best results, use ripe, in-season tomatoes.
- The bread can be grilled instead of toasted for a smokier flavor.
- Can be prepared ahead, but assemble just before serving to keep bread crispy.
