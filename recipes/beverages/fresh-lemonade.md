# Fresh Lemonade

**Prep Time:** 10 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 5 minutes (for simple syrup)  
**Servings:** 6-8

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups fresh lemon juice (about 8-10 lemons)
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup water (for simple syrup)
- 6 cups cold water
- Ice cubes
- Lemon slices and fresh mint for garnish

## Instructions

1. Make simple syrup: Combine 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water in a saucepan.
2. Heat over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves completely.
3. Let simple syrup cool.
4. Juice the lemons and strain to remove seeds and pulp.
5. In a large pitcher, combine lemon juice, cooled simple syrup, and 6 cups cold water.
6. Stir well and taste; adjust sweetness if needed.
7. Refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour.
8. Serve over ice with lemon slices and mint garnish.

## Notes

- For best flavor, use fresh lemons at room temperature (they juice easier).
- Adjust sugar to taste - some prefer it more tart or sweet.
- Can add fresh berries or herbs like basil for variations.
- Simple syrup ensures sugar dissolves completely (no grainy texture).
