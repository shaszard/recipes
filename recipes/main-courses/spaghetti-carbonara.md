# Spaghetti Carbonara

**Prep Time:** 10 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 15 minutes  
**Servings:** 4

## Ingredients

- 1 pound spaghetti
- 6 oz pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
2. Cook spaghetti according to package directions until al dente.
3. While pasta cooks, fry pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy (about 5-7 minutes).
4. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, cheese, and a generous amount of black pepper.
5. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.
6. Add hot drained pasta to the skillet with pancetta (off heat).
7. Quickly pour egg mixture over pasta, tossing continuously.
8. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time to create a creamy sauce.
9. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs gently; do not overheat or eggs will scramble.
10. Serve immediately with extra cheese and black pepper.

## Notes

- Traditional recipe uses no cream - the creaminess comes from the eggs and pasta water.
- Work quickly to prevent eggs from scrambling.
- Guanciale is traditional, but pancetta or bacon can substitute.
- Use freshly grated cheese for best results.
